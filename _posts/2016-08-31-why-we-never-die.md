  As a child, I was terrified of death. It was often in the twilight hours,
  between the moment of lying down and the imperceptible instant of slipping off
  to sleep, that the terror would arise. The thought of vanishing completely
  from the world, of being engulfed in ineradicable darkness, would seize upon
  me and crush with it the very existence of the world.
