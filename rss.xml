Implying care and attention to detail, rather than just grabbing the moment recklessly.</h1><p>Ansel Adams' name is synonymous with landscape photography, but a new interview with Adams' daughter-in-law Jeanne reveals more about a lesser known side of his work. The long-time CEO of the Ansel Adams Gallery talks with Advancing Your Photography's Marc Silber, discussing the legendary photographer's portraiture and architectural imagery, and shares some stories of Adams' interactions with his workshop participants.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6cae596f061f56384c049ff90c7d7cf3/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2F3.img-dpreview.com%2Ffiles%2Fp%2FE~TS940x788~articles%2F7587024559%2Fjeanne_adams_interview.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drone footage of aurora over Iceland is just what your weekend needs</h1><p>Maybe it's unreasonably hot where you live, like it is here.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I always thought they should be capitalised. But then I also know that capitalised is not spelled capitalized!</h1><p>The general rule says that seasons should not be capitalized. They are common nouns, not proper nouns. But there are a few exceptions that call for capitalization. Capitalize the name of a season when it's the first word of a sentence or part of a proper noun.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/189918bb6a95eb147ef5f45a78b64aa6/noop.gif?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcontenthub-static%2Fblog%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fblog7593.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nauseation …</h1><p>Nauseous means causing nausea or tummy troubles, and nauseated means feeling sick-even though the two are often used to mean the same thing. Think of this guide as the Pepto-Bismol to the upset stomach of confusable words, and read on for the definition, spelling, and usage of nauseous and nauseated.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/bfa2ba940aff3f9eac86e2aaccf2b924/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcontenthub-static%2Fblog%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F01%2FNauseous-Brains-Nauseated-Zombies.jpg"></article>]]></description>
